**Maritest** development process. You can contribute to bugfixing, add feature requests, code optimization,

You can directly submit your ideas or contributions to the Maritest github repository or if you found a bug whenever
using this project, you can raise issue first on github issue

Guidelines
----------

if you wanted to make a contribution request, use standard git-workflow as usual:

- fork or clone the original repository
- run and test first locally
- fix some bugs or typos or something else
- before committing, don't forget to write a unit test of the changes that you've made (applies to adding features or finding bugs)

You can run unittest with the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    # to run all of unit tests
    coverage run --source=. -m unittest discover

- create a new branch first before making a request
- commits
